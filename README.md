<h1> To-Do List </h1>

<h2>Brief Introduction </h2>

A To-Do app that allows you to create project files, add your todos into any project files you choose, edit the todos and toggle them when they're completed.  Each todo can be set a priority where the user can visually see tasks that are high priority, medium priority, or low priority.  Further, each todo can be given a due date so that users can organize their everyday tasks, and remove any task they wish whenever they desire it.  Each project can be toggled through so that the todos in each project list can be viewed on the webpage.  The app also supports localStorage so that users can save their todos on their computers when they refresh or close the browser.

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

The completion of this project has grown my skills in DOM manipulation and usage of Factories as well as the Module pattern.  Furthermore, it allowed me to get my feet deeper into webpack and hone my knowledge on OOP principles.  By applying the SOLID principles, mainly the Single Responsibility in my code logic I've been able to experience more what Software Engineering can be like.

<h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>

A challenge I faced from tackling this project was picturing how I would split up all the different functions while maintaining SOLID principles.  I solved this problem by taking some time to write down my thoughts on how I wanted to set up the functions.  After spending some time writing code down and figuring out the structure of my application, I applied the written code to the program and I was able to complete my work much easier.

<h2>Live Demo</h2>

To use the app, if you wish to create todos in the default folder, simply click on the 'Create ToDo' button on the bottom of the page.  You can create new project folders by clicking on the 'Create Projects' button on the bottom-left side of the page.  Window prompts will ask you to enter information such as the title, description, due date, and priority of the task, all of which must be entered.  The date must be entered in 'mm/dd/YYYY' format as well.
